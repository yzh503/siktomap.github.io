<p><strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> <strong>~/.bash_login</strong>,  and  <strong>~/.profile</strong> are read by login shell in that order, but only the first one existing will be loaded by default.</p>

<p><strong>~/.bashrc</strong> is loaded in non-login shell if it exsits.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Bash was developed as a part of GNU project, and is now extensively distributed in the POSIX sytems. It loads a collection of startup files to help create an environment. <strong>~/.profile</strong>, <strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> and <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> are the common ones located in the home directory.</p>

<h1 id="what-are-the-differences">What are the differences?</h1>
<p><strong>~/.bash_profile</strong>, <strong>~/.bash_login</strong>, <strong>~/.bash_logout</strong> and <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> are specific to the Bash shell, while .profile is a generic config file read by many shells when their specific config files are missing.</p>

<h3 id="login-shell">Login Shell</h3>
<p>When bash is a login shell, or invoked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--login</code>, it firstly reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. Then, it looks for <strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> <strong>~/.bash_login</strong>,  and  .profile, in that order. It <strong>only reads the first one</strong> that is existing and readable.</p>

<h3 id="non-login-shell">Non-login Shell</h3>
<p>When it  is  not a login shell, bash reads and executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and <strong>~/.bashrc</strong>, if they exist.</p>

<h3 id="exiting">Exiting</h3>
<p>When a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands from the file <strong>~/.bash_logout</strong>, if it exists.</p>

<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--noprofile</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--norc</code> may be used to start a login and non-login shell without loading profiles.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--rcfile</code> option will force bash to read and execute commands from a user specified file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and <strong>~/.bashrc</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="lazy-loading">Lazy Loading</h3>
<p>For convenience, people usually load other profiles in one. For example, in .profile,</p>
