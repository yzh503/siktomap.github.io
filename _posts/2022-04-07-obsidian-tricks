title: Obsidian Tricks 
---

I have recently transferred my notes from Notion to Obsidian for various reasons: 

1. Obsidian supports local files, which can be synchronised in many ways. 
2. Full data ownership leads to better privacy. 
3. Notion is slow on very lage pages, easically with a lot of $\LaTeX$ equations.
4. Most of the Notion functionalities are supported in Obsidian with plugins.

Over the past week I have been discovering tricks of using Obsidian, and here they are: 

Can I create a table of content for my folders?
---

Use [Folder Note](https://github.com/xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin) to create index for each folder. `cmd/ctrl + click` Will create a note that contians the table of content for the folder. You may edit the default template in the plugin's options in settings to match your style. 

Another useful plugin is [Zoottelkeeper](https://github.com/akosbalasko/zoottelkeeper-obsidian-plugin), which automatically creates an index file in each folder. 

Notion has database. What does Obsidian have? 
---

Use markdown tables with [Advanced Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian) plugin, or use [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin to query the notes in any folder. For example, I query all my journal article notes as a table in the Folder Note page: 

![](/img/Pasted%20image%2020220407201415.png)

With code: 

![](/img/Pasted%20image%2020220407201941.png)

To filter or sort, just add `where` and `sort` clause in the query.

How do you install plugins?
---
Browse core and community plugins in settings, or visit their github repositories. 

Is there a easier way to use Latex?
---

Create your own shortcut. For example, replace `\boldsymbol` with `\b`

```
$$\newcommand{\b}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}}$$
```

Put this into any page and visit it once when Obsidian launches, the command will work until Obsidian is closed. 

Use [Quick Latex](obsidian://show-plugin?id=quick-latex) plugin to autocomplete. 



Can I modify the theme/fonts/colours?
---

Open the css snippets folder from settings - appearance, create a css to set variables or override the theme. For example, I want a minimum width for tables so that short words are not wrapped: 

```
th {
  white-space: nowrap !important; 
}
td {
  min-width: 5em !important;
}
```

Why does my light theme look so grey and unclear?
---

You might have turned on translucent window. Turn it off in settings - appearance. 

How are files and attachments managed?
---

If you copy or drag images/files into the eidtor, it will place the file into a default folder for attachment, which is configurable in the settings. Do not use Wikilinks in case you want to migrate notes to other software. 

How do you sync across devices?
---

Save the vault in OneDrive/Google Drive/iCloud/Dropbox or use the paid add-on service from Obsidian. 

How do you link to blocks?
---

- type `[[` and the note name, and then type `#` to select the heading. 
- Use [Copy Block Link](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-copy-block-link) plugin
- Put tags around places you want to link, so you can click the tag and get a list of locations.
