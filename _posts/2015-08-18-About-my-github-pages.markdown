I decided to run my github pages on 16th Aug 2015. 

Back to a few days ago, I was struggling with installing Kali Linux on my native hard drive for a better performance. Unfortunately, Kali didn't seem to like me. Problems kept showing up. I saw lots of people posting threads saying they got the same issues. Hours and hours later, with all the problems solved, writing a tutorial was the first thing that came up to my mind. No solution to the problem could be found on the internet, so my posts would be technically helpful for people who have the same problems. Think a little bit further. If I put all my work in one place, it would be much handier for me to show others. That's why I'm building this site.

Anyway, I'll try to keep things neat and tidy. Cheers.
